## Game Explanation

**How The Game Works:**

In this game you have a Player, Enemies (Bugs), Gems and Hearts. The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the player loses a life and will be moved to the start position. In the start the player has 3 lifes and when he loses all of his hearts he will die and the game resets. The player can gain lifes by collecting randomly generated hearts. The score increses each time the player reaches the water or the player collects randomly generated gems. Every 4 times the player reaches the water the level will increase and one enemy will be added and their speed will be increased.

**Goal:**

The goal is to reach the highest score possible!
